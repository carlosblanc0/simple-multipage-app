## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>
This repository contains non-sensetive code from one of my pet projects which aims to build a simple - yet effective, app. 

## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>
Feel free to use (or tweak it) for your own use. You will only need to copy and paste it onto a newly created Flutter project. Pro-tip: edit the <b>pubsepc.yaml</b> file on your project so that is affects the images and/or additional files you might want to implement on your own project. However, some added functionality such as Firebase, won't work properly without some tweaking which is exected.
